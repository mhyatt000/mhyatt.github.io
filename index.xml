      <description>I am a Computer Science major at Loyola University Chicago. Some of my hobbies include hiphop dance, lifting weights, and construction projects. I have close ties to my extended family and it is a long standing tradition for us to have Sunday night dinner together.
I first became interested in computer science during my high school classes. I have always been fascinated by the idea of efficiency, and using tools in order to complete goals in innovative ways.</description>

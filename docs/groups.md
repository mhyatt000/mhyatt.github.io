## [Rambler Investment Fund (RIF)](https://www.ramblerfund.com/)

RIF is a student managed portfolio valued at over 1 million dollars. RIF provides students with opportunities to build skills in financial analysis and risk assessment as well as to network with industry professionals.

I am a developer on RIF's quantitative analytics team and write software to automate and visualize stock analysis. These are the projects I have contributed to:

- [tickerbot](https://github.com/mhyatt000/tickerbot)
    - a slackbot designed to react to messages in [slack](https://slack.com/) and return a pdf stock report upon request.

- [PortfolioTrackerRevisited](https://github.com/RamblerInvestmentFund/PortfolioTrackerRevisited)
    - an html tearsheet which shows RIF's performance since 2020
    - published on our website

- [MachineLearningProj](https://github.com/RamblerInvestmentFund/MachineLearningProj)
    - implements SVM and LSTM models using scikit-learn and TensorFlow 2.0 in attempt to predict the daily gradient of opening stock values and make trading decisions based on its predictions.

## [Loyola AI Club (LAiC)](https://luc.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/laic)

LAiC was founded in 2022 and aims to provide Loyola students with the resources required to learn and build connections within the field of AI.  Our events this year include hosting workshops and speakers to talk about industry experience as well as data science competitions.

I am a part of the Education Board at LAiC and work in a group to schedule speaker events and design workshops that interest our members and facilitate their learning.
